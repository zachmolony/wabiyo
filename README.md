# Wabiyo website

Website and clothing store for creative collective wabiyo and clothing company Wabiyo. 

### Desktop JS Game

The desktop version of the site consists of a dungeon platformer game, written in javascript with the p5 module. The player/customer can play through the short game to find the item they want and check out.

### Mobile VR

The mobile version uses a simple layout though the background of the store is a Virtual-Reality scene controlled using the motion of the device, programmed and implemented using the A-FRAME VR framework.
