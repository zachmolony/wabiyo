# wabiyo.com   

Website and clothing store for creative collective wabiyo.

The site consists of a mobile store and desktop store, the desktop store is different from a normal store in that the customer must beat a dungeon platformer game to buy the clothes. 

The game is coded in javascript using p5.js, with assets made by wabiyo and sourced from itch.io.

The mobile version has a familiar online store interface, but the background is a virtual reality experience controlled by the phone's accellerometer. The virtual reality is built using A-FRAME.

All code is written from scratch and original. Still currently under development.

The site is currently hosted via github pages at: wabiyo.com
